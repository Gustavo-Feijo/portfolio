## About

My personal portfolio contains information about me, contact details, and, as I develop it, a list of my projects.

---

Developed using various technologies, with Next.js as the base. The technologies used include:

- ### Next.js
- ### React.js
- ### Framer Motion
- ### Tailwind CSS
- ### Next-Intl
- ### Jest

---

The development process involved simple prototyping with Figma, creating the base layout, which was then implemented in the front end with React and enhanced with animations through Framer Motion.

I used Next-Intl to add translations applied to the corresponding routes, which can be generated at build time for creating static HTML.
